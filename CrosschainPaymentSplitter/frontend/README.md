This project is built using Next.js, a popular React framework for building server-rendered React applications. It is designed to serve as a starting point for building web applications with Next.js. The project includes some basic configuration and structure to help you get started quickly.

Key features of this project include:

- Next.js for server-rendered React applications.
- Routing with clean, SEO-friendly URLs.
- CSS Modules for styling components.
- ESLint and Prettier for code linting and formatting.
- A basic folder structure for organizing your code.

## Getting Started
